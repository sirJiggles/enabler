# What

This is the slack bot, it is just a function in the end that checks all the things and sends out some messages. see the main root file for more information. also if you want to run it locally maybe comment out the handler and `export default program()` from the program root in index.ts

It is a handler as I tend to just test it direct on aws as `pulumi up` takes like 5 secs ðŸŽ‰
